  before or after the call (they won't be referenced inside):

  It is safe to modify it->value (but do not change it->key or
  it->key_len), or to call cuckoo_hash_remove(hash, it).

  Calling cuckoo_hash_insert() inside the loop will reorder the
  elements so that some may then be visited twice, while others
  (including the new one) may not be visited at all.  In other words,
  don't do this.
